# 🚀 Deployment Fix - Lockfile Mismatch Issue

## ❌ Problem
The deployment failed because `pnpm-lock.yaml` is outdated and doesn't match `package.json`. Three dependencies were added but the lockfile wasn't updated:
- `html2canvas@^1.4.1`
- `jspdf@^3.0.2` 
- `puppeteer@^24.17.1`

## ✅ Solution

### Option 1: Use npm (Recommended)
1. Delete the pnpm lockfile:
   ```bash
   rm pnpm-lock.yaml
   ```

2. Install with npm to create fresh lockfile:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: update lockfile for deployment"
   git push
   ```

### Option 2: Update pnpm lockfile
1. Update the pnpm lockfile:
   ```bash
   pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile
   ```

2. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add pnpm-lock.yaml
   git commit -m "fix: update pnpm lockfile"
   git push
   ```

### Option 3: Vercel Dashboard Fix
1. Go to your Vercel project settings
2. In "Build & Development Settings" → "Install Command"
3. Override with: `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile`
4. Redeploy

## 📝 Files Updated
- ✅ `package.json` - Added postinstall script for Prisma
- ✅ `vercel.json` - Added to force npm usage
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Updated to prevent lockfile conflicts

## 🔧 Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in Vercel:
```
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_key_id
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_key_secret
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

## ✨ After Deployment
1. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

2. Seed database (optional):
   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```

The deployment should now work correctly! 🎉
